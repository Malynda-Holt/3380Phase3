# 3380Phase3
Database Application that performs operations on holt_company database

Getting Started: 
Download all 4 .java files and store them in the same folder. 

Prerequisites: 
To work with this program, you will need an environment to run Java code and the database "holt-company" that the code is written to work with.

Usage: 
This project is used to operate on a mySQL database. The code supports basic deletion and insertion operations for table records.
The primary data is stored in the client, employee, project, and team tables. The user may also assign employee records to teams,
assign employees to clients as client managers, and assign teams to projects. 

Roadmap: 
Running the code displays a simple interface - The user inputs a number that corresponds with the table and is able to view and manipulate data in the table.
Navigating to a table will automatically display records stored in that table.
Some operations are only available when the user has navigated to the relevant table. If you navigate to the Employee table, you won't have access to the Assign Project operation.
